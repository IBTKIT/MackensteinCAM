A camera-based system for automatic identification and localization of electrodes.

Features:
- localizes multiple electrode positions at once
- accuracy 1Â±1 mm
- system of markers for robust identification using an error-correcting code

Includes all algorithms from the paper "Automatic camera-based identification and 3-D reconstruction of electrode positions in electrocardiographic imaging":
- http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/bmt-2014-0018
- explains all processing steps
- includes validation

It requires

* the open source computer vision (OpenCV) library (version 2.4.6.0), which is distributed under a BSD license
* the Augmented Reality library from the University of Cordoba (ArUco) (version 1.1.0), which is distributed under a BSD licence

Note that this page is still work-in-progress, and the tool will shortly be given a:

* documentation
* proper Make-file
